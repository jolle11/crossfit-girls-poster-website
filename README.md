# Crossfit Girls Poster

This is my attempt to transform the crossfit girls poster into a webpage with a slight retouch.

This is what I'm talking about ⬇️

## Fonts used:

[Gelasio](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gelasio) for the wod lines.

[Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue) for the wod titles and types.

[Public Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans) FOR THE GIRLS

Keep in mind the these fonts are the closest I was able to find in Google Fonts.

## Things I made differently

-   Placing "THE GIRLS" on top. Better readability.
-   No need for the crossfit logo (and to avoid any problems I could have for copyright)
-   Added a button to change between imperial and metric units.

## Created using:

-   Vite ⚡️
-   **M**ongoDB 🗄️
-   **E**xpress 🥡
-   **R**eact ⚛️
-   **N**ode 🎒
